This is a repository for a python script created for unauthorised game and program installations on citrix school accounts, 
specifically that of West Suffolk College. Some programs may not function fully and others will reqiure accounts 
or purchases to have been previously made. To use, download and run the python file, and this will download other files as required.
Download times may take up to 5 minutes with some programs, but shouldnt be any longer depending on download speeds. If an installation fails, 
be sure to uninstall the program before restarting the installation proccess. Have fun playing!
